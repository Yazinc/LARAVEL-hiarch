Hierarchical Management for Laravel Projects & Apps. 

Organizes Your Tables, Lists, Menus and Products in Child/Parent With unlimited Levels. 

What is this?
Professional Apps present data in organize way, We often call it Child/Parent Management.

What to do if you have 4 to 15 tables and your app demands or looks great if you have to organize all those tables like Products, Accounts, Customers, Vendors in Child/Parent or Categories / Subcategories methods, I am sure,  lot of hard work/code work  will be involved for each elements to render in HTML sections where its required, and handing of massive code will be another issue.
 Thus at this point, I made this Gadget to solve those issues. This product works with Larval Framework only.


How it Work- Implementation : 
1.	Download Master and Unzip : Get  “yazinc” folder to your laravel “App” Directory. 
2.	Define your own controller.  Check  controller code as below:


            namespace App\Http\Controllers;
            use App\User;
            use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;
            use App\yazinc\hiarch;   	

Your Controller / laravel project now “Hiarch” enabled.
